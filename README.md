# Metacrafter-s-Challenges
In this repository i will share the challenges problem which i got during my completion of Metacrafter's course.

Challenge 1: In this challenge i declared four datatypes and then declare setter and getter function for them. Although in solidity we got getter function bydefault durring running of contract.

Challenge 2: In this challenge i take the value of ether in form of uint and then declare the set and get function for ether and then convert it into wei and gwei.

Challenge 3: When We Use the simple operation and having a gas limit of 300k, the contract will run smoothly but in complex operation the gas usage is higher and we have a limit of 300k so it throw an error "out of gas".

Challenge 4: In this challenge i created a contract named calculator and declare 4 function inside it for addition,subtraction,multiplication and division.
