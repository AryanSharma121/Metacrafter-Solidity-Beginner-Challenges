# Metacrafter-s-Challenges
In this repository i will share the challenges problem which i got during my completion of Metacrafter's course.

Challenge 1: In this challenge i declared four datatypes and then declare setter and getter function for them. Although in solidity we got getter function bydefault durring running of contract.

Challenge 2: In this challenge i take the value of ether in form of uint and then declare the set and get function for ether and then convert it into wei and gwei.
